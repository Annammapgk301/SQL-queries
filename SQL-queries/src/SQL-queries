60. What is the difference between UNION and UNION ALL ?

Both UNION and UNION ALL is used to select information from structurally similar tables. That means corresponding columns specified in
the union should have same data type. For example, in the above query, if
First_Name is DOUBLE and Last_Name is STRING above query
wont work. Since the data type of both the columns are VARCHAR,
union is made possible. Difference between UNION and UNION ALL is
that , UNION query return only distinct values.


61. Select employee details from employee table if data exists in incentive table ?
